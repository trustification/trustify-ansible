# Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer Ansible collection

The purpose of this Ansible collection is to automate the deployment of the Red Hat Trusted Profile Analyzer (RHTPA 2.x) service on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deploying RHTPA 2.x by using Ansible is a Technology Preview feature only.
> Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does not recommend to use them for production.
> These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
> See the support scope for [Red Hat Technology Preview](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/) features for more details.

## Description

The RHTPA service is the downstream redistribution of the [Trustify](https://github.com/trustification/trustify) project.
The automation contained within this Git repository installs and configures the components of RHTPA to run on a single RHEL server by using a standalone containerized deployment. A Kubernetes-based manifest creates containers that uses [`podman kube play`](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-kube-play.1.html).

The RHTPA Ansible collection deploys the following RHTPA components:

- [Trustify](https://github.com/trustification/trustify)

## Prerequisites

A RHEL 9.3+ server should be used to run the Trustify components.

Install and configure Ansible on a control node before performing the automated deployment.

## Minimum hardware requirements

- 24 vCPU,
- 48 GB Ram,
- 100 GB Disk space

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.16.0 or greater
- Python 3.10.0 or greater
- RHEL x86_64 9.3 or greater.
- Installation and configuration of Ansible on a control node to perform the automation.

You must provide the following external services:

- An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, such [RedHat Single Sign On](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/sso/) or Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cognito.
- A new PostgreSQL database.

## External Services Configurations

### RedHat Single Sign On OIDC

- [Red Hat Single Sing On](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on/)
- [Setup RHSSO](TODO)
- [Setup Cognito](TODO)

### Postgresql

Create a PostgreSQL database and configure your database credentials in the environment variables, see 'Verifying the deployment section',
other database configurations are in the roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml

Utilize the steps below to understand how to setup and execute the provisioning.

## Configurations on the controller node

On the controller node export the following environment variables:

1. Export the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your relevant information:

   ```shell
      export TPA_SINGLE_NODE_REGISTRY_USERNAME=<Your Red Hat image registry username>
      export TPA_SINGLE_NODE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<Your Red Hat image registry password>
      export TPA_PG_HOST=<POSTGRES HOST IP>
      export TPA_PG_ADMIN=<DB ADMIN>
      export TPA_PG_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<DB ADMIN PASSWORD>
      export TPA_PG_USER=<DB USER>
      export TPA_PG_USER_PASSWORD=<DB PASSWORD>
      export TPA_OIDC_ISSUER_URL=<AWS Cognito or Keycloak Issuer URL. Incase of Keycloak endpoint auth/realms/chicken is needed>
      export TPA_OIDC_FRONTEND_ID=<OIDC Frontend Id>
      export TPA_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID=<OIDC Walker Id>
      export TPA_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET=<OIDC Walker Secret>
   ```

2. Choose between Keycloak or AWS Cognito, and update the `roles/tpa_single_node/defaults/main.yml` file accordingly.

3. If you are using AWS Cognito as your OIDC provider, then create an environment variable pointing to the Cognito domain:

```shell
export TPA_OIDC_COGNITO_DOMAIN=<AWS Cognito Domain>
```
4. By default is executed a single importer instance with four concurrent job, if is needed is possible to have four
   importer instance with a single job inside of each configuring 
   ```
   tpa_single_node_importer: multiple
   ```

## Provision

In order to deploy Trustification on a RHEL 9.3+ VM:

1. Update the content of the `inventory.ini` file in the project:

```
[trustification]
<IP_TARGET_MACHINE>

[trustification:vars]
ansible_user=<username>
ansible_ssh_pass=<ssh_password>
ansible_private_key_file=<path to private key>
```

2. Configure if needed the `ansible.cfg` file in the project:

```
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory.ini
host_key_checking =
```

3. Path for TLS certificates files:

Copy your certificate files in `certs/` directory using following names:

- server-cert.pem
- server-key.pem
- rootCA-cert.pem

Optionally, the certs directory variable `tpa_single_node_certificates_dir` under `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main.yml` file can also be updated with a directory certs for below variables:

- tpa_single_node_tls_trust_anchor

- tpa_single_node_tls_server_cert
- tpa_single_node_tls_server_key

Refer `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main_example_aws.yml` and `roles/tpa_single_node/vars/main_example_nonaws.yml`

## Installation

Run this collection

```shell
export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH="roles/" ;
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini play.yml -vv
```
